# ุณ++/see++ An Arabic pseudo-language
Is a pseudo-language syntactically identical to C++/11  based on Arabic script and language. The implenmentation relies on using the GNU compiler and directly lexically translates ุณ++ source code to valid C++/11 code .

## Motivation

### Why Develop an Arabic Programming Language?
The main motivation of this project is to provide support for Arabic speakers and encourage their involvement in the software development world. People should not be disadvantaged in computer science because of a different linguistic background. This project is an exploration of the practicality of using Arabic in a programming language.

### Why C++? Why not create your own language?
There are several motivations as to why I decided to use C++. C++ offers the ability to both use high level abstraction by using OOP, but also gives the programmer the ability to get their hands dirty and work on a low level.

Regardless of whether a language is elegant or not, a language's success depends on its adoption, usage and support. The GNU compiler has been in the works for years, and reinventing the wheel and creating dedicated support for the language would lessen its appeal and increase its logistical complexity (which I as a university student cannot work with at the time).
